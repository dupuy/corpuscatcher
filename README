1. INTRODUCTION

   CorpusCatcher is a corpus collection toolset. It can help you to build
   language or topic specific corpora from publicly available web resources.
   This can be very useful for many purposes, especially for data to build
   spell checkers.

   It was written in Python and can therefore easily be used, in part or in
   whole, in other Python projects. It was originally written to simplify the
   use of BootCaT (<http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/marco/tools_and_resources.html>),
   but has grown to replace the used BootCaT parts with Python ports.

   If you are interested in CorpusCatcher, or working on spell checkers, you may
   be interested in Spelt (<http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/spelt/index>).

2. DOCUMENTATION

   See the wiki at http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/corpuscatcher/index
   (complete instructions are in the README file there).

3. INSTALLATION

   These tools are simple command-line tools written in Python, so all that is
   needed for installation is to extract all the files in the distribution
   archive into a directory.

   Dependencies:

   1. Python >= 2.4
   2. mechanize module (only tested with version 0.1.7b)
   3. pysearch module (only tested with version 3.0)
