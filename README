1. INTRODUCTION
    CorpusCatcher is a corpus collection toolset created to facilitate the
    creation of next-generation spell-checkers by Translate.org.za.

    It was written in Python and can therefore easily be used, in part or in
    whole, in other Python projects. It was originally written to simplify the
    use of BootCaT (http://sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/tools_and_resources.html),
    but has grown to replace the used BootCaT parts with Python ports.


2. DOCUMENTATION
    For complete and up-to-date see the README page on the project wiki at 
    http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/corpuscatcher/index. Alternatively,
    see the README in HTML format (README.html).
